# Graph_Project
Propriety graph generator and analyzer that can work from csv files of different formats to give information such as amount of nodes, edges, shortest pathes, and more. Was built working with the London Tube System. All use case examples can be found within the jupyter notebook along with metrics and KPIs tracked for the graphs and code. <br />
Current list of algorithms which can be used on a graph created by the library: shortest path, travelling-salesman, and shortest path between components. <br />
Future additions: DP TSP implementation and Flow algorithms <br />
